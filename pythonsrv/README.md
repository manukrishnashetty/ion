# ionserver
IONMP compliant server. IONMP is an openstandard plug and play protocol for IOT nodes and servers. The specification is available as a separate repository

##Caution##

Code commit process for this repository started 7th March 2020. While we have implemented a large chunk of the protocol specification in our server, we will be adding files to this repository one by one. 

Till we complete the checkin of all files, the code in this repository may not be easily usable. Once we have checked in all files, we will update this readme along with instructions. At that point of time, this caution message will go away. 

Why this staggered process : Truth be told, we had not thought of this as an opensource project. At Qantom software, we took a decision to make this project opensource, much after we had started work on it. Since this was initially a commercial code base, we have been using this in implementations for our clients. Before releasing into the opensource, we are carefully analysing the source code, file by file and making sure that no sensitive data is getting out to the opensource repository.
